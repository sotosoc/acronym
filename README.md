# Acronyms Database

These are the technical acronyms in my high tech life.

## Acronyms.txt

The output summary of all defined acronyms.

## makefile

Running:

  make

will turn the ./src/files into a single ASCII file: Acronyms.txt.

## ./src

The structure chosen is one file per acronym. If there is more than one meaning
for an acronym, then both are in the same file.

## ./bin/summary

The script to turn the files and contents into a summary text file to be viewed.

This could then be changed into a postscript file (enscript) or PDF file
(ps2pdf).
